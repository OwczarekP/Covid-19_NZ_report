    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>In June 2020 New Zealand's governments announce the country covid-free. While it didn't last long New Zealand is still one of the countries with low covid-19 cases and covid-related deaths. In this report, we will focus on comparing the covid-19 cases in New Zealand to other countries and try to analyze the government's response to the pandemic.
        Additionally, we will show the demographic of covid-19 patients and how the pandemic influences different regions of New Zealand's economy.</p>

    <p>To realise how exactly covid-19 looks like, we will compared it to the other countries:

    <li>Norway (NOW) - similar density in Europe</li>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>To better understand how exactly New Zealand handles COVID-19 and how the pandemic impacts the country, let's look at more detailed data. First, we take a look into the ratio between cases, recovers, and deaths and later look into the demographic of the COVID-19 patients.</p>

    <h3>Vaccination</h3>
    <p>Although the pandemic has not that terrified result in New Zealand as in other countries it is still important to start proper vaccination.
Since the 28th February 2021, New Zealand started process of vaccinating its citizens.</p>

    <h3>Alerts</h3>
    <p>As we mention before New Zealand didn't use the term lockdown - instead they introduce the 4 levels alert system, which was changed based on the COVID-19 cases. We will check how the system changed based on the date and pandemic status.</p>

    <h3>Impact of COVID-19</h3>
    <p><q>Before Covid-19, Tourism was New Zealand's largest export industry and delivered $40.9 billion to the country. Tourism made a significant positive impact on regional economies supporting employment by directly employing 8.4 percent (229,566 people) of the New Zealand workforce.</q>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In this report, we focused on analyzing the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. As we showed, even though the pandemic was quite quickly got under control it still impacted the economy of the country. Most of the cases were presented in young people, which can result in very few death cases and much more recovered. The number of total cases was small enough even compared to countries in similar density or climate region. New Zealand government introduced the alert level system to control the lockdown system and they responded accordingly to the number of new cases. As we can see New Zealand didn't slow down the vaccination even after having minimalizing their new cases. </p>
