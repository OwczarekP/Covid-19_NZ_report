### Abstract

In June 2020 New Zealand's governments announce the country covid-free. While it didn't last long New Zealand is still one of the countries with low covid-19 cases and covid-related deaths. In this report, we will focus on comparing the covid-19 cases in New Zealand to other countries and try to analyze the government's response to the pandemic. Additionally, we will show the demographic of covid-19 patients and how the pandemic influences different regions of New Zealand's economy.

### Conclusion
In this report, we focused on analyzing the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. As we showed, even though the pandemic was quite quickly got under control it still impacted the economy of the country. Most of the cases were presented in young people, which can result in very few death cases and much more recovered. The number of total cases was small enough even compared to countries in similar density or climate region. New Zealand government introduced the alert level system to control the lockdown system and they responded accordingly to the number of new cases. As we can see New Zealand didn't slow down the vaccination even after having minimalizing their new cases.
